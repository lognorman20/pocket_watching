## Overview
### Description
[Description of your app]
This mobile application tracks crypto portfolios in a social media like fashion. It displays the various assets that a user has invested in and allows for comments to be posted along with updates on each investment decison made.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:**
Social, Education
- **Mobile:**
Push, real-time, 
- **Story:**
The value of this application is being able to visualize all assets in a crypto portfolio, view other people's portfolios, and discuss portfolios in a manner like a social media application.

To friends and peers, this idea would lead to a good response because of the value that it adds and the necessity that it fills.
- **Market:**
The size of the market is anyone that is invested in cryptocurrency, which is a considerable amount of people given that a Pew Research Center survey showed that 16% of US adults said they personally have invested in, traded or otherwise used a cryptocurrency.

This application provides value to the niche of people who would like to track all of their assets in one place and learn about other people's porfolios, which is quite a well-defined audience.
- **Habit:**
A user would check this app 3-4 times a day to keep up with other portfolios and track their investments. This is possible by using push notifications about changes in a portfolio, a new comment made on a given portfolio, and updates based on market voltatility. The average user can either consume or create, the point of the application is to allow people to share their experiences and those that are just starting out can learn from those that have more experience and are already invested.
- **Scope:**
The technical difficulty of this application is the right amount to finish before the end of the project. A stripped down version of this application is still interesting to build because it displays all crytpo assets in one place. The project that I want to build is clearly defined and attainable.
